I need a logo design. I have a 3d printer, a VoronZero to be precise and I gave it the nickname "The Small Beast". One day I will convert one of my other printers, an Ender 5 into a mercury one, so also a corexy printer and plan to name it "The Big Beast".

I now need some logo ideas. Btw the small beast has a black and violet color combo while the ender 5 has a black and red color combo
